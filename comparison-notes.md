## Comparison notes

There are other classification systems in use by physical libraries such as
*LCC / Library of Congress Classification* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Classification
and *Dewey Decimal Classification*.
See a comparison here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Dewey_and_Library_of_Congress_subject_classification

These classification systems appear to have divisions which are designed to a fair
degree for optimal physical grouping of objects (e.g. books, maps and CDs) in a physical
building - and so the groupings perhaps don't quite make sense or at least "may not be
optimal" from a pure classification point of view, even though such system are optimal,
or at least convenient, for the storage of thousands of physical items (and in
particular considering physical storage space and space expansion required over time).

Although this Large Personal Digital Library project may facilitate an individual (or small/
community library) to record information about which books they physically hold in their
collection, the primary intention is to optimize for a digital library - that is, for the
storage and indexing of content items as files.

From this "digital storage" point of view, the optimal filesystem/ directory layout is one
which is most useful to the lay person browsing their own LPDL on their own filesystem or
through LPDL indexing software.

There is no need to group different [sub-]categories merely for storage purposes - we can
separate every [sub-]category that ought be separated since this will not cause a physical
storage sytsem problem. So a full and comprehensive folder/ directory/ file system
hierarchy is therefore preferred over a hierarchy naming system optimised for storage of
physical items.

Physical storage will often be offline or "nearline", where a drive is plugged in as
needed, and it is the job of LPDL software to facilitate this lookup (via one or more
inexes) and to then suggest which named external device might still have a copy.

The actual indexing, categories etc, ought be completely separate from physical storage.
